\usage{
getFRED(variables, keep_all = TRUE, rename_variables = NULL, lagged = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{variables}{A character vector of FRED series IDs.}

\item{keep_all}{Logical. If TRUE, performs a full (outer) merge (keeping all dates);
if FALSE, uses an inner merge.}

\item{rename_variables}{A character vector of new names for the series. If not provided,
the series names (in lowercase) will be used.}

\item{lagged}{A logical vector (or single logical) indicating whether to compute lagged
returns for each series. The lagged return is computed as:
\deqn{(current\ value / previous\ value) - 1.}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the merged FRED series.
}
\description{
Downloads one or more FRED series from the St. Louis Fed website, optionally computes
lagged percentage changes, renames the variable columns, and merges all series by date.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Download GDP (without lagging) and Unemployment Rate (with lagging)
  df <- getFRED(variables = c("GDP", "UNRATE"),
                rename_variables = c("gdp", "unrate"),
                lagged = c(FALSE, TRUE))
}
